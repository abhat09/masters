# Masters Application
This repository contains a sample of coding and data science projects that I have completed and/or am currently working on. Below is a description of the files.

36-468: Text Anaylsis:

  Coffee_break1: This RMD file contains the data analysis for the first project in the course. For this project, I analyzed a corpus of young adult books (Twilight and Divergent) and a corpus containing a collection of children's literature to identify similarities and differences between the genres. The data analysis includes tokenization, frequency and token distributions, key word analysis, collocation networks, and sentiment analysis.
  
  cb_2: This RMD file contains the data analysis for the second project in the course. This project serves as a proof-of-concept for our much larger final project. I collected a corpus of Taylor Swift's lyrics and a second corpus of Beyonce's lyrics. The goal was to identify if there exists any differences between the singers' lyrics with respect to parts of speech usage and the general topics being sung about. The data analysis includes parts of speech tagging, multidimension analysis and factor loadings, PCA biplot, sentiment anaylsis, frequency, and keywords in context. 
  
  midterm mini: This RMD file contains the data analysis for the midterm project, for which we had to submit an executive report highlighting how writing produced by ChatGPT is similar and/or different from student writing and academic writing. The data analysis includes multidimensional analysis, PCA, parts-of-speech tagging, keyness analysis, hedges-and-boosters, and frequency. 
  
  468_Final: (note: in progress) This RMD file contains the beginning of my analysis for my final project. I will use topic modeling, stemming, multidimensional analysis, PCA biplot, parts-of-speech tagging, word clouds, and keywords in context tables.

36-490 Statistics Capstone:
  
  Simulation: (note: in progress) This python file contains the simulation model my capstone group is building to simulate the Artistic Gymnastics Competition for the Paris Olympics in 2024. The goal of the model is to find the team of 5 USA athletes (for both the men's and women's teams) that can win the most medals. This project will be entered into the data challenge being hosted by the USOPC.
  
  EDA: This RMD file contains the elementary data analysis I did to investigate relationships between variables in our dataset before determining how we should construct our analytics model. 

36-315 Statistical Graphics and Visualization: 
  
  315_Final: (note: in progress) This RMD file contains the beginning of my analysis for this course's final project. I will be investigating what factors influence the number of goals a soccer player makes in a season using data from the 2021-2022 UEFA Men's Soccer season. This analysis includes elementary data analysis and multilinear regression modeling. 

15-112 Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science:
  
  tp3: This python file contains my implementation of a restaurant game (based off of the games Flo's Diner and Penguin Diner 1 & 2). For this project, I had to implement graphic models, Djikstra's Algorithm for finding the shortest path between nodes on a weighted graph, and Object Oriented Programming.
